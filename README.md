Five fun facts about me:

1 : The first code I wrote was to remove borders from photos on a blogspot post. The photos were of chai spice summer squash muffins with white chocolate chips. They were delicious. I was hooked.

2 : When I was in third grade I dressed up as Albert Einstein for holloween. People confused me for Mark Twain.

3 : My husband and I eloped in Tahiti. We had known each other less than a year. When you know, you know. 

4 : I once swam alongside three dolphins off the California coast. It was out of this world. 

5 : My current favorite wine is Georis sauvignon blanc. It has hints of tropical fruit and guava with a slight mineral finish.
