Five fun facts about me:

1 : The first code I ever wrote was to remove the borders from photos on a blogspot post. The photos were of chai spice summer squash muffins with white chocolate chips. They were divine.

2 : When I was in third grade I dressed up as Albert Einstein for holloween. People confused me for Mark Twain.

3 : I once saw two dolphins off of the Torpedo Wharf near the Golden Gate Bridge. I love dolphins. I also love otters.

4 : My current favorite wine is Georis Sauvignon Blanc. It has hints of tropical fruit and guava with a slight mineral finish. 

5 : My husband and I eloped in Tahiti. We had known eachother for nine months. When you know, you know.
